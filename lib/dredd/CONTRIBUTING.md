## üêõ Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, please try to first [search existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see whether your problem wasn't already discussed.

To report a bug, [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/new). To report privately, e.g. to alert the maintainers about a security problem, please [contact Apiary Support](https://apiary.io/support).

## üí¨ Asking questions

Before asking a question, please try to first search [Dredd's documentation](https://dredd.org), [Apiary Help](https://help.apiary.io/).

You can always [contact Apiary Support](https://apiary.io/support), but we prefer if you ask publicly, because it allows to spread the knowledge across the community of all Dredd users:

- [Open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/issues/new)
- [Ask on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) with the [dredd tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dredd)

Also, we consider unclear or missing documentation to be a bug, so often your question can start a valuable improvement.

## üìñ Improving documentation

The documentation is written [as code](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) in the [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format and its source files are located in the [docs](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/tree/master/docs) directory. It is published automatically by the [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) when the `master` branch is updated.

If you want to propose improvements to the documentation, you don't need to install the whole project. Usually it is just fine to use the [GitHub's editing features](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd/edit/master/docs/installation.rst).

When committing your changes, please use the [prefix your commit message](https://dredd.org/en/latest/internals.html#sem-rel) with `docs`:

```
docs: add more OpenAPI examples
```

You can learn more about Dredd's codebase in the [Internals](https://dredd.org/en/latest/internals.html) section of the documentation.
